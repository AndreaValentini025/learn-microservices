# DevSecOps Pipeline Development

This is a toy version of **product-service** microservice of the [Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Third Edition's Chapter 6](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Spring-Boot-and-Spring-Cloud-Third-Edition/tree/main/Chapter06) repository.

In this repository we will build a DevSecOps pipeline for this microservice and we will push the entire service inside a **Google Cloud VM**.
