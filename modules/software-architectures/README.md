# Labs

## Lab 1: Understanding Monolithic Architectures
**Objective:** Analyze a monolithic application to identify its components and structure.

**Instructions:**
- Select an existing monolithic application (e.g., a simple e-commerce or blog application) and explore its codebase.
- Identify the different layers of the architecture (presentation, business logic, data access) and document how they interact.
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using a monolithic architecture, focusing on maintainability, scalability, and deployment.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Students will gain an understanding of the structure of monolithic architectures.
- They will analyze the pros and cons of monolithic applications and how they impact software development.

## Lab 2: Implementing a Modular Monolith
**Objective:** Refactor a monolithic application into a modular monolith to improve maintainability.

**Instructions:**
- Take the existing monolithic application from Lab 1 and refactor it into a modular structure.
- Organize the codebase into distinct modules, ensuring that each module has a clear responsibility (e.g., user management, product catalog).
- Use techniques such as the Dependency Inversion Principle to decouple modules and improve inter-module communication.
- Test the modular application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Students will learn how to refactor a monolithic application into a modular structure.
- They will understand the benefits of modularity, including improved maintainability and clearer separation of concerns.

## Lab 3: Transitioning to Microservices
**Objective:** Begin the transition from a modular monolith to microservices architecture.

**Instructions:**
- Choose a module from the modular monolith created in Lab 2 and refactor it into a standalone microservice.
- Define clear boundaries for the microservice, ensuring it encapsulates its own data and business logic.
- Implement RESTful APIs for the microservice to facilitate communication with other services.
- Deploy the microservice independently and ensure it integrates smoothly with the remaining monolithic application.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Students will understand the process of transitioning from a modular monolith to microservices.
- They will gain experience in defining microservice boundaries, creating RESTful APIs, and deploying independent services.
